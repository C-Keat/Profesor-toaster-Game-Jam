# Profesor-toaster-Game-Jam

This project was created in the BRAINS EDEN gaming festival event in Cambridge in 2019, our team was up against a wide variety of skill levels, we were given a weekend to come up with an idea and create it, to be presented in front of judges at the end. 

My contribution to this project was coding the bots, to make sure they worked and functioned as intended also asset creation, drawing the 2D sprites from scratch.
